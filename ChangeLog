# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
Date based versioning is now used in this project.  This is so that it doesn't get confused with the Dropbox desktop client.

	* Add Debian Trixie and Fedora 40 to build matrix

Version 2023.09.06

	* Fix various uses of deprecated APIs, such as the "DeprecationWarning: isSet() is deprecated" warning.

	* Remove the long-broken `dropbox puburl` command.
	* Don't print a ticker to stderr if it's not a tty.

Version 2020.03.04
------------------
	* Coerce XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP to "Unity". This works around the
	dropbox binary that will only activate the indicator icon and menu
	on Ubuntu Unity < 16.10. This patch coerces XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP to
	report as "Unity" for the budgie-desktop
